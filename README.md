**Hey there. 👋** My name is Keeton Feavel and I'm a software and reverse engineer 👨‍💻. My job is to learn how things work at a low level and then break them, so I'm basically paid to void warranties. It's a lot of fun. 😁 When I'm not writing code for work, then I'm probably writing code for Panix, which is a unix-like kernel that my friend @micahswitzer and I are working on together.

In my free time outside of work and programming I play a lot of games like Smash Ultimate, Splatoon 2, Animal Crossing, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, and may other (Nintendo & non-Nintendo) games.
