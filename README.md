**Hey there.** You should check out my primary project, [@XyrisOS](https://github.com/XyrisOS) (previously Panix), which is (planned to be) a unix-like microkenel kernel that my friends [@micahswitzer](https://github.com/micahswitzer), [@JamesOrson](https://github.com/JamesOrson), and I are working on together.

Feel free to create an issue or fork anything you find interesting.
